A decentralized, blockchain-based platform designed to authenticate and validate digital content, specifically targeting videos and their creators. As AI-generated content continues to advance and saturate the internet, Verity aims to build trust and preserve the originality of content through a combination of cutting-edge technologies.

By leveraging the power of the Theta Network, Verity establishes a "proof of creation" system for video content, ensuring the authenticity and credibility of the videos shared on the platform. With a Chrome extension, a dedicated video sharing platform, and a robust identity management system, Verity caters to content creators, news sources, governments, and activists who demand accurate and reliable information.

Verity's advanced authentication process incorporates AI-generated content detection to identify and prevent the spread of fake content. Additionally, utilizing zk-proofs for pseudonymous accounts, Verity strikes a balance between privacy and accountability.
